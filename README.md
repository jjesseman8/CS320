# CS320

I follow these guidelines to ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure. First, I thoroughly plan and define requirements, breaking down the software into smaller components and using a systematic approach for implementation. I strive to write clear, maintainable code and rigorously test it, including both expected and edge cases. I make sure to incorporate security measures from the start, following secure coding practices, implementing access controls, and staying updated on security threats.

When it comes to interpreting user needs and incorporating them into my program, I take several steps. I engage with users, conduct interviews, and surveys to gather requirements directly from them. I carefully document these requirements, analyze and prioritize them, and continuously validate them with users and stakeholders. Based on the requirements, I create a design that focuses on understanding the problem domain, incorporating modular and scalable design principles, abstraction and encapsulation, and considering reusability and user-centered design. Throughout the design process, I also consider maintainability, extensibility, performance, and security aspects to ensure a well-rounded software solution.
